# Analyzing Shark Tank Pitch Data

## Project Overview:

For this project, we will be exploring, analyzing and modeling data about pitches and products from the show Shark Tank. The dataset includes pitcher demographic information, basic information about products, and financial information about investments made. This is likely to be a iterative project where we will primary focus on data exploration before moving into some form of predictive modeling. The ultimate goal is to build a model that will predict success of a pitch and expected investment valuations based on pitcher demographic and product information.

## Selecting/Cleaning Data

The dataset comes from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-us-dataset). We found that several columns were incomplete or inaccurate and have supplemented the information presented in Kaggle with our own research. Additionally, we have done some standard data cleaning (filling nulls, standardizing data types) to make the data explorable.
